Response to Traumatic Events
Psychological Response Data on the Traumatic Nature of 600 Written Events
After looking through the code book for the Psychological Data on the Traumatic Nature of 600 Written Events. This study [https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jopd.46], I have decided that I am particularly interested in the response of a traumatic event. I am not sure which items I will use regarding on the response for a traumatic event dependence (what happens after) so for now I will include all the relevant items in my personal codebook.
Response to a traumatic event is a good starting point, I need to determine what it is about the response on a traumatic event that I am interested in. It strikes me the way we behave, and I say we because there are different kinds of traumatic events. The way we response after a traumatic event, the way life looks for people according to their background. Does the way you grow up impacts the way you think a feel after a traumatic event? I see my family and people around me that have gone through a traumatic even and it makes me think how they get to through it. Some seemed to get it together, get help and take it one day at a time, but others I see they run, think they are alone, and feel their life finished and have nothing else to offer or do.
I decide that I am most interested in exploring the association between the decision they take after a Traumatic event and the choices they make after.
I add to my codebook items reflecting Traumatic Events
